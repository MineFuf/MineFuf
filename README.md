# About me
- I'm student at Prague IT highschool
- Doing programming for a long time, but still suck at it
- Main languages are C#, Python and Rust

I'm not doing specific type of projects, just what I want to do at the moment
Thought I'd like to stick to making smaller, command-line tools

# Also tried
- HTML/JS
  - React/Next
  - Mineflayer
- Go (sucks hard, prove me wrong)
- Java/Kotlin
- C/C++
