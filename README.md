# About me

- I'm an IT student, currently at highschool, soon at a University
- Been doing programming for a long time, but still got a long way to go
- My main languages are C#, Python and **Rust**

- I enjoy anime, dev news, tech news and science in general.

I'm not working on a specific type of projects, just what I want to do at the moment. But mostly CLI tools and small single-use tools. Mostly interested in system languages, new ones (Rust, Zig), but even the older ones (C). Still, even I like some highlevel languages, C# for example. And I want to learn at least one functional, even if just a little bit (F#).

## TMaze

For some unknown reasons, THE project of mine is [TMaze](https://github.com/ur-fault/TMaze). It's literally just a game about solving mazes, it runs in the terminal and is written in Rust. I use it as goto project for trying stuff out, so it has things like Dockerfile, sounds, GitHub Actions releases, assets. There are some huge things planned (modding support), and hopefully multiplayer, althought it's planned to add as a mod.
